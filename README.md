# AIX Fusion 🚀

AIX Fusion is an **Autonomous AI Services Platform** that brings together multiple intelligent AI agents into a single, unified system. Each agent operates independently as a microservice and provides powerful AI capabilities through a clean and interactive web interface.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔍 **Web Search Agent** – Perform real-time searches and retrieve summarized information using live web data.
- 🖼️ **Image Generation Agent** – Generate high-quality images from text prompts.
- 📄 **OCR Agent** – Extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition.
- 🧠 **Text Summarization Agent** – Summarize large bodies of text into concise formats.
- 💬 **Code Generation & Explanation Agent** – Generate and explain code in multiple programming languages.
- 🎙️ **Speech-to-Text Agent** – Convert speech/audio recordings into transcribed text using Whisper.


## 🧠 How It Works

AIX Fusion is powered by:
- **FastAPI** for building microservice APIs.
- **LangChain** to manage multi-agent workflows and LLM orchestration.
- **Groq API + Meta LLaMA 3** for high-performance inference.
- **Streamlit** for a clean and interactive frontend UI.

Each AI agent is a standalone service with its own endpoint and UI, and the system intelligently routes user requests to the appropriate service.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Groq Inference, OpenAI Whisper
- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS.
- **Utilities:** Playwright (for web scraping), AutoScraper (optional), SerpAPI
