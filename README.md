# AIX-Fusion
AIX Fusion is an Autonomous AI Services Platform that integrates multiple intelligent agents—such as OCR, image generation, speech-to-text, and web search—into a unified system. Each AI agent operates independently as a microservice, and users can access these services through a clean, interactive UI.
